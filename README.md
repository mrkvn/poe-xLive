*Path of Exile Trade Live Search for mobile.*

If you're an Exile who wants to keep your live searches on, even if you're asleep, AFK, or doing something else other than playing Path of Exile, then this app is for you.

## Notes:
- The purpose of this app is to be notified when a valuable item, of your choice, hits the market.

- Just like in the official trade site, request is subject to limitation, Thus, search for items as specific as possible.

- You need to use an app that can sync clipboard between your mobile device and your PC. This is useful for copying query ID from PC and pasting it to the app. This is particularly required when you copy the whisper text from the app to paste it to PC or in-game as you can't type manually the whole text or is not practical at all for that matter.

## Usage:
- Copy and Paste your PoE session ID to the app. If you're not familiar on how to get your session ID, there are guides on Youtube or search for how to get it.

- Use the official trade site of Path of Exile https://www.pathofexile.com/trade and search for the item you want to live search for.

- Copy the query ID from the URL.
```
Example:
From this URL: https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search/Ritual/O683lOCE
Query ID is the last characters after slash (/). i.e. O683lOCE
```

- Paste it on the app where it says QueryID. Take note that query IDs are case sensitive. Thus, as mentioned above, you need to use an app that can sync clipboard between your mobile device and PC so that you just have to copy/paste without manually typing it.

- If your search connects, you just have to wait for new items to hit the trade market.

- When new items come in, they will go to the bottom of the screen, unlike in the official site, where they go to the top.

- Click the whisper button to copy the whisper text and paste it to your PC or in-game. Again, you need an app to be able to do copy/pasting between mobile and PC.
